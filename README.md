# GUS - Git Utility Script

A typed nodejs cli tool to automate daily used git processes and provide utilities based on git.

## Installation

Install gus as a global npm package as a result you will be able to use gus for any project on your machine. But if you wish to install it in a specific project, install it as a `dev dependency` because there is no need of gus when your project is in production.

Installation using `npm`

```cmd
npm i -g gus
```

Installation using `yarn`

```cmd
yarn global add gus
```
